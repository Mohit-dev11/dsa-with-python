A **Linked List** is a fundamental data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, making them efficient for insertions and deletions. There are several types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, each with its unique properties and use cases.

In this section, you'll find Python implementations of various linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching. Each implementation is accompanied by detailed explanations and example code to help you understand the underlying concepts. Additionally, we've included common interview questions and practice problems to test your knowledge and improve your problem-solving skills.
